# SPTL-Keras-Tutorial
This repo contains a short tutorial for the BU SPTL on creating and training neural networks with the Keras high-level API for Tensorflow. Keras is included with Tensorflow, which can be installed with
```
  pip install tensorflow
``` 
The tutorial notebook is `notebook.ipynb`, which is an ipython notebook that can be opened with jupyter notebook/lab or with VSCode containing an annotated version of the exercise. `scratch_space.ipynb` is a record of the code we ran during the tutorial, which loosely follows `notebook.ipynb` but is not annotated and contains digressions or additional content.
